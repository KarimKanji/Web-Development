                </h4>
                <p>
                    Time under tension means that in order to efficiently
                    break down muscle tissue you need to have
                    sufficient amount of stress on the specified muscle/muscles.
                    This can be applied in practice in many ways.
                    A general guideline is that every set you do
                    should last about 40 sec. But thats not everything
                    Another basic principle in weight lifting is
                    eccentric and concentric movements. You need to
                    control the weight during the entire range of motion
                    and make sure that your eccentric movement is slower
                    than your concentric movement.

                    Tearing down muscle is how more muscle is built.
                    <br>In order to build muscle you need stimulus
                    <br>When you break down the muscle by training hard
                    <br>the body repairs the broken muscle and it becomes
                    <br>stronger. In order for this to happend you need:
                    <br>Sufficient stimulus, protein, energy and water.

                <p>
                    The mind and muscle connection means that the person
                    performing the excerise has good control over the
                    muscle or muscles that is/are currently working.
                    By really feeling the muscle contract, and by controlling
                    the weight you improve your mind and muscle connection.
                    By having a good mind and muscle connection you can better
                    your progress in building muscle since the muscle you want
                    to be working on is more isolated.

                    To build muscle you must have a good diet for many reasons.
                    With a good and well rounded diet you make sure to have
                    all the micro and macro nutrients you need to feel
                    and function well. All macros are important but how much of each
                    you consume each day is not as important as just simply getting
                    enough protein and having energy. What you should "count" are your
                    calories. Bodyfat comes down to calories in and calories out.
                    If your calorie expendature is bigger than your intake you will
                    burn fat. When it comes to protein you should aim to consume
                    1-1,5g of protein per lean mass kg. Protein also has a
                    higher thermodynamic effect meaning that it takes more calories
                    for the body to break down protein than it does for other macros.
                    Protein also keeps you more satiated which means you will keep
                    your cravings and hunger in controll.

                    Muscle is broken in the gym but it is built during rest.
                    If you want to maximize your gains you have to sleep enough.
                    Rest can infact be one of the biggest restricting factors
                    when it comes to building muslce. Lacking in this department
                    will for sure affect your gains, mood and energy.

                    Depending on what your goals are you should schedule
                    your training in a certain way. There are many different
                    protocols or "plans" that are available on the market
                    many of them are not science based so be careful with what
                    you spend your money on. A diet plan is the hardest to make
                    so if you find yourself truly in need of one you should get
                    it custom made. A training plan is relativly easy to make
                    with some research and understanding of splits and recovery
                    window for muscles.
